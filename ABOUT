I’m sathiya, a passionate data enthusiast and aspiring freelance datascience.
I enjoy uncovering hidden insights from real-world data and using machine learning to make data-driven predictions that solve practical problems.
My goal is to help businesses and clients make smarter decisions through clean data, clear visualizations, and reliable models.
Through this Linear Regression project, I strengthened my ability to:
Clean and analyze complex datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy).
Visualize meaningful trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Build and evaluate predictive models using scikit-learn.
These skills allow me to take freelance projects involving data cleaning, analysis, dashboard creation, and predictive modeling — delivering results that combine technical accuracy with business insights.
I’m excited to keep learning advanced ML techniques like decision trees, logistic regression, and ensemble methods to expand my freelance toolkit and help more clients make data-informed choice
