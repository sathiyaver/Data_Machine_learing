🏥 Medical Charges Prediction

This repository contains the code and analysis for predicting medical insurance charges based on various factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

📘 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to explore, clean, and analyze the insurance dataset and then train a Linear Regression model to predict individual medical charges.

🔑 Key Steps

Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded the dataset (insurance.csv)

Reviewed data types, structure, and summary statistics.

Data Cleaning

Verified no missing values were present.

Feature Engineering

Applied one-hot encoding for categorical features (sex, smoker, region).

Scaled numerical features (age, bmi, children) using StandardScaler.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions and feature relationships.

Identified key correlations influencing medical charges.

Model Training

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Trained a Linear Regression model.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R² metrics.

Visualization of Results

Created visual comparisons of Actual vs. Predicted Charges.

Analyzed residuals to assess model performance.

📊 Key Findings

Dataset includes 1338 records of individuals with various demographic and health factors.

No missing values detected.

Categorical features successfully encoded and numerical features scaled.

EDA Insights:

Medical charges show a right-skewed distribution (majority have low costs, few have very high costs).

Smoker status is the strongest predictor of higher medical charges.

Age and BMI show positive correlation with medical charges.

Model Performance:

Achieved R² ≈ 0.78, explaining ~78% of variance in medical costs.

Good prediction performance for average cases, but less accurate for high-charge outliers.

Residual analysis suggested mild heteroscedasticity.
